        <li>I will not explicitly deny the truth, and I will not explicitly tell lies.</li>
        <li>I will not make explicit promises that I may break.</li>
        <li>I will speak carefully and precisely.</li>
        <li>I will not commit adultery.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>but I may choose not to discuss a subject if doing so could adversely affect my interests in the near future (e.g., “did you eat my cookie” -> yes), or the distant future (e.g., “did you eat my cookie” -> no).</li>
        <li>and I will not break the promises that I do make.</li>
        <li>I am free to say misleading things, so long as I intend to mislead.</li>
        <li>I won’t have sex with a person who is in an exclusive relationship if I'm aware of the exclusivity clause, and I will do my best to make sure that I know.</li>
